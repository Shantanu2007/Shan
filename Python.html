    <h1>Python Introduction:    </h1>
    <div><p>
<mark>What is Python?</mark><br>
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.<br>
<br>
It is used for:<br>
<br>
web development (server-side),<br>
software development,<br>
mathematics,<br>
system scripting.<br>
What can Python do?<br>
Python can be used on a server to create web applications.<br>
Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.<br>
Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.<br>
Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.<br>
Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.<br>
<br>
</p></div>
<div><p>
<mark>Why Python?</mark><br>
<br>
Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).<br>
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.<br>
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.<br>
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.<br>
Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.<br>
<br>
Good to know<br>
The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial.<br>
However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.<br>
In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment,<br>
such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.<br>
Python Syntax compared to other programming languages<br>
<br>
Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.<br>
Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.<br>
Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes.<br>
Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.<br>
    </p></div>
    <hr>
    <pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
        Example:
        print("Hello, World!")
    
       Output: Hello, World!
    </pre>
    <hr>
    <h1>Python Syntax:</h1>
    <pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
        Python Indentation
        Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
        
        Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
        
        Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
    
    <hr>
        Example:
        if 5 > 2:
          print("Five is greater than two!")

        Output: Five is greater than two!

        <hr>
        Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
        Example:
        if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!")

        Output:
        <p1 style="color:red">File "demo_indentation_test.py", line 2
        print("Five is greater than two!")
        ^
        IndentationError: expected an indented block</p1>
        <hr>
        <mark>Python Variables</mark>
       In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:
       Example:
       x = 5
       y = "Hello, World!"

       print(x)
       print(y)

       Output: 5
               Hello, World!

               <hr>
        <mark>Comments</mark>
        Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.
               
        Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:
        <hr>       

</pre>
<h1>Python Variables:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Variables
Variables are containers for storing data values.

Creating Variables
Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
Example:
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
Output: 5
        John

        <hr>
Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
Example:
x = 4
x = "Sally"
print(x)

Output: Sally
<hr>
<mark>Casting</mark>
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

Example:
x = str(3)
y = int(3)
z = float(3)

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
Output:
3
3
3.0
<hr>
Get the Type
You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
Example:
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
Output:
< class 'int'>
< class 'str'>
<hr>

<mark>Single or Double Quotes?</mark>
String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

Example:
x = "John"
print(x)
#double quotes are the same as single quotes:
x = 'John'
print(x)
Output: 
John
John
        <hr>

<mark>Case-Sensitive</mark>
Variable names are case-sensitive.
        
Example:
a = 4
A = "Sally"

print(a)
print(A)
Output:
4
Sally
        <hr>

</pre>
<h1>Python - Variable Names:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
    Variable Names
   1. A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
   2. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
   3. A variable name cannot start with a number
   4. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
   5. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
    Example:
    myvar = "John"
    my_var = "John"
    _my_var = "John"
    myVar = "John"
    MYVAR = "John"
    myvar2 = "John"
    
    
    print(myvar)
    print(my_var)
    print(_my_var)
    print(myVar)
    print(MYVAR)
    print(myvar2)
   Output:
   John
   John
   John
   John
   John
   John
   <hr>
Illegal variable names:

2myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
my var = "John"

Output:
<p style="color:red">SyntaxError: invalid syntax</p>
<hr>
<mark>Multi Words Variable Names</mark>
Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.

There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

<mark>Camel Case</mark>
Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

myVariableName = "John"
Pascal Case
Each word starts with a capital letter:

MyVariableName = "John"
Snake Case
Each word is separated by an underscore character:

my_variable_name = "John"
</pre>
<h1>Python Variables - Assign Multiple Values:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
    Many Values to Multiple Variables
    Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
    Example:
    x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"

    print(x)
    print(y)
    print(z)
    Output:
    Orange
    Banana
    Cherry
    <hr>
One Value to Multiple Variables
And you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
Example:
x = y = z = "Orange"

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

Output:
Orange
Orange
Orange
<hr>
Unpack a Collection
If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

Output:
apple
banana
cherry
<hr>
</pre>
<h1>Python - Output Variables:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Output Variables
The Python print() function is often used to output variables.
x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)

Output:Python is awesome
<hr>
In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:
Example:
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

Output:Python is awesome
<hr>
You can also use the <mark>+</mark> operator to output multiple variables:

Example:
x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)

Output: Python is awesome
<hr>
In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an error:

Example:
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)

Output:
<p style="color:red">TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'</p>
<hr>
</pre>
<h1>Python - Global Variables:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
    Global Variables
    Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.
    
    Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.
    
    Example
    Create a variable outside of a function, and use it inside the function
    
    x = "awesome"
    def myfunc():
    print("Python is " + x)

    myfunc()
    Output: Python is awesome
    <hr>
    If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function.
    The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.

    Example
    Create a variable inside a function, with the same name as the global variable
    x = "awesome"

    def myfunc():
    x = "fantastic"
    print("Python is " + x)

    myfunc()

    print("Python is " + x)
    Output:
    Python is fantastic
    Python is awesome
    <hr>
<mark>The global Keyword</mark>
Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.

To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.

Example:
def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)

Output:Python is fantastic
<hr>
</pre>
<h1>Python Data Types:</h1>
<div><p>
Built-in Data Types
In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
</p></div>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
    ext Type -->	str
    Numeric Types  -->	int, float, complex
    Sequence Types  -->	list, tuple, range
    Mapping Type  -->	dict
    Set Types  -->	set, frozenset
    Boolean Type  -->	bool
    Binary Types  -->	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
    None Type  -->	NoneType

    <hr>
   <mark>Getting the Data Type</mark>
   You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:
   Example:
   x = 5
   print(type(x)) 

   Output: < class 'int'>
   <hr>
<mark>Setting the Data Type</mark>
In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:

Example                     	Data Type	
x = "Hello World"       -->     str	
x = 20	     	     	 -->     	int	
x = 20.5	     	      -->	     	float	
x = 1j	     	     	  -->    	complex	
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]	 --> list	
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")	 --> tuple	
x = range(6)	 -->  range	
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}	 --> dict	
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}  -->	set	
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})  -->	frozenset	
x = True	     	    -->    bool	
x = b"Hello"	     	 -->   bytes	
x = bytearray(5)     	 -->   bytearray	
x = memoryview(bytes(5))	 -->   memoryview	
x = None	                 -->   NoneType	
 
<hr>
<mark>Setting the Specific Data Type</mark>
If you want to specify the data type, you can use the following constructor functions:

Example	                      Data Type	
x = str("Hello World")	-->  str	
x = int(20) --> 	int	
x = float(20.5)	 --> float	
x = complex(1j) --> 	complex	
x = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))	--> list	
x = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) -->	tuple	
x = range(6) -->	range	
x = dict(name="John", age=36) -->	dict	
x = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) -->	set	
x = frozenset(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) -->	frozenset	
x = bool(5)	--> bool	
x = bytes(5) -->	bytes	
x = bytearray(5) -->	bytearray	
x = memoryview(bytes(5)) -->	memoryview	
<hr>

</pre>
<h1>Python Numbers:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
    Python Numbers
    There are three numeric types in Python:
    
    1.int
    2.float
    3.complex
    Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:
    Example
    x = 1    # int
    y = 2.8  # float
    z = 1j   # complex
 
    To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:
    x = 1
    y = 2.8
    z = 1j

   print(type(x))
   print(type(y))
   print(type(z))
   Output:
   < class 'int'>
   < class 'float'>
   < class 'complex'>
<hr>
<mark>Int</mark>
Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.

Example
Integers:

x = 1
y = 35656222554887711
z = -3255522

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
<p1>Try it yourself</p1>
<hr>
<mark>Float</mark>
Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

Example
Floats:

x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -35.59

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
<p1>Try it yourself</p1>
<hr>
<mark>Complex</mark>
Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:

Example
Complex:

x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
<p1>Try it yourself</p1>
<hr>
<mark>Type Conversion</mark>
You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:

Example
Convert from one type to another:
x = float(1)

#convert from float to int:
y = int(2.8)

#convert from int to complex:
z = complex(1)

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
Output:
1.0
2
(1+0j)
< class 'float'>
< class 'int'>
< class 'complex'>
<hr>
<mark>Random Number</mark>
Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used
to make random numbers:

Example
Import the random module, and display a random number between 1 and 9:

import random

print(random.randrange(1, 10))
Output: 9
<hr>

</pre>
<h1>Python Casting:</h1>
<div><p>
Specify a Variable Type<br>
There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting.<br>
Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.<br>
<br>
Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:<br>
<br>
int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal<br>
(providing the string represents a whole number)<br>
float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a<br>
float or an integer)<br>
str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals<br>
</p></div>
<hr>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Example:
x = int(1)
y = int(2.8)
z = int("3")
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
Output:
1
2
3
<hr>
Example:
x = float(1)
y = float(2.8)
z = float("3")
w = float("4.2")
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
print(w)
Output:
1.0
2.8
3.0
4.2
<hr>
</pre>
<h1>Python Strings:</h1>
<div><p>
Strings
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

'hello' is the same as "hello".

You can display a string literal with the print() function:
</p></div>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
<mark>Assign String to a Variable</mark>
Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:

Example:
a = "Hello"
print(a)

Output: Hello
<hr>
<mark>Multiline Strings</mark>
You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:

Example:
a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)

Output:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
<hr>
<mark>Strings are Arrays</mark>
Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.

However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
Example:
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1])
Output:
e
<hr>
Example:
for x in "banana":
  print(x) 
  output:
  b
  a
  n
  a
  n
  a
  <hr>
 <mark>Python - Slicing Strings</mark>
 Slicing
You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.

Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.

Example
Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included):
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])
Output: llo
<hr>
<mark>Negative Indexing</mark>
Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string:
Example
Get the characters:

From: "o" in "World!" (position -5)

To, but not included: "d" in "World!" (position -2):

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[-5:-2])

Output: orl
<hr>
<mark>Python - Modify Strings:</mark>
Upper Case
Example
The upper() method returns the string in upper case:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.upper())

Output: HELLO, WORLD!
<hr>
<mark>Lower Case</mark>
Example
The lower() method returns the string in lower case:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.lower())

Output:hello, world!

<hr>
<mark>Remove Whitespace</mark>
Whitespace is the space before and/or after the actual text, and very often you want to remove this space.

Example
The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end:

a = " Hello, World! "
print(a.strip()) # returns "Hello, World!"

Output:Hello, World!
<hr>
<mark>Replace String</mark>
Example
The replace() method replaces a string with another string:

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a.replace("H", "J"))

Output: Jello, World!
<hr>
<mark>Split String</mark>
The split() method returns a list where the text between the specified separator becomes the list items.

Example
The split() method splits the string into substrings if it finds instances of the separator:

a = "Hello, World!"
b=print(a.split(",")) # returns ['Hello', ' World!']
print(b)
Output: ['Hello', ' World!']
<hr>
<mark>Python - String Concatenation</mark>
String Concatenation
To concatenate, or combine, two strings you can use the + operator.

Example:
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + b
print(c)
Output: HelloWorld

<hr>
<mark>Python - Format - Strings</mark>
tring Format
As we learned in the Python Variables chapter, we cannot combine strings and numbers like this:

Example:
age = 36
txt = "My name is John, I am " + age
print(txt) 

Output:
<p1 style="color:red">Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "./prog.py", line 2, in <module>
  TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str</p1>
<hr>
But we can combine strings and numbers by using the format() method!

The format() method takes the passed arguments, formats them, and places them in the string where the placeholders {} are:

Example
Use the format() method to insert numbers into strings:
age = 36
txt = "My name is John, and I am {}"
print(txt.format(age))

Output: My name is John, and I am 36
<hr>
The format() method takes unlimited number of arguments, and are placed into the respective placeholders:

Example:
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want {} pieces of item {} for {} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price)) 

Output:
I want 3 pieces of item 567 for 49.95 dollars.
<hr>
<mark>Python - Escape Characters</mark>
Escape Character
To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.

An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.

An example of an illegal character is a double quote inside a string that is surrounded by double quotes:

Code 	Result	
\'	--> Single Quote	
\\	--> Backslash	
\n	--> New Line	
\r	--> Carriage Return	
\t	--> Tab	
\b	--> Backspace	
\f	--> Form Feed	
\ooo --> Octal value	
\xhh --> Hex value
<hr>
<mark>Python - String Methods</mark>
tring Methods
Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings.

Note: All string methods return new values. They do not change the original string.

Method      --> 	Description
capitalize()  --> Converts the first character to upper case
casefold()	 --> Converts string into lower case
center()	 --> Returns a centered string

  <h1>Python Booleans:</h1>
  <div><p>
Booleans represent one of two values: <mark>True</mark> or <mark>False</mark>.<br>
<br>
Boolean Values<br>
In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False.<br>
<br>
You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, True or False.<br>
<br>
When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:<br>
  </p></div>

  <h1>Python Lists</h1>
  <div><p>
List<br>
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.<br>
<br>
Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.<br>
<br>
Lists are created using square brackets:<br>
</p></div>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Example:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
Output:['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
<hr>
<mark>List Items</mark>
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

<mark>Ordered</mark>
When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.

<mark>Changeable</mark>
The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

<mark>Allow Duplicates</mark>
Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:
Example:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]

print(thislist)
Output:['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'apple', 'cherry']
<hr>
Python Collections (Arrays)
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

1.List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
2.Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
3.Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
4.Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

<mark>Python - Access List Items</mark>
Access Items
List items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number:
Example:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[1])

Output: banana
<hr>
<mark>Python - Change List Items</mark>
Change Item Value
To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:

Example:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1] = "blackcurrant"

print(thislist)
Output: ['apple', 'blackcurrant', 'cherry']
<hr>
<mark>Python - Add List Items</mark>
Append Items
To add an item to the end of the list, use the append() method:
Example:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

thislist.append("orange")

print(thislist)
Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']
<hr>
Insert Items
To insert a list item at a specified index, use the insert() method.

The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:
Example:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.insert(1, "orange")
print(thislist)

Output: ['apple', 'orange', 'banana', 'cherry']
<hr>
Python - Remove List Items

Example:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.remove("banana")
print(thislist)

Output: ['apple', 'cherry']
<hr>
Remove Specified Index
The pop() method removes the specified index.

Example:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.pop(1)
print(thislist)

Output: ['apple', 'cherry']
<hr>
<mark>Python - Loop Lists</mark>
Loop Through a List
You can loop through the list items by using a for loop:

Example
Print all items in the list, one by one:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in thislist:
  print(x)

  Output:
  apple
  banana
  cherry
  <hr>
Example:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
i = 0
while i < len(thislist):
  print(thislist[i])
  i = i + 1
Output:
apple
banana
cherry
<hr>
<mark>Python - List Comprehension</mark>
List Comprehension
List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

Example:

Based on a list of fruits, you want a new list, containing only the fruits with the letter "a" in the name.

Without list comprehension you will have to write a for statement with a conditional test inside:

Example:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "kiwi", "mango"]
newlist = []

for x in fruits:
  if "a" in x:
    newlist.append(x)

print(newlist)

Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'mango']
<hr>
<mark>Python - Sort Lists</mark>
Sort List Alphanumerically
List objects have a sort() method that will sort the list alphanumerically, ascending, by default:
Example:
thislist = ["orange", "mango", "kiwi", "pineapple", "banana"]

thislist.sort()

print(thislist)
Output: ['banana', 'kiwi', 'mango', 'orange', 'pineapple']
<hr>
<mark>Python - Copy Lists</mark>
Copy a List
You cannot copy a list simply by typing list2 = list1, because: list2 will only be a reference to list1, and changes made in list1 will automatically also be made in list2.

There are ways to make a copy, one way is to use the built-in List method copy().

Example:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = thislist.copy()
print(mylist)

Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
<hr>
<mark>Python - Join Lists</mark>
Join Two Lists
There are several ways to join, or concatenate, two or more lists in Python.

One of the easiest ways are by using the + operator.

Example:
list1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

list3 = list1 + list2
print(list3)
Output: ['a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3]

<hr>
Allow Duplicates
Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:
<hr>
<mark>Python - Access Tuple Items</mark>
Access Tuple Items
You can access tuple items by referring to the index number, inside square brackets:

Example:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple[1])

Output: banana
<hr>
<mark>Python - Update Tuples</mark>
Change Tuple Values
Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its values. Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.

But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.

Example:
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(x)
y[1] = "kiwi"
x = tuple(y)

print(x)

Output: ("apple", "kiwi", "cherry")
<hr>

Add Items
Since tuples are immutable, they do not have a build-in append() method, but there are other ways to add items to a tuple.

1. Convert into a list: Just like the workaround for changing a tuple, you can convert it into a list, add your item(s), and convert it back into a tuple.

Example:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
y = list(thistuple)
y.append("orange")
thistuple = tuple(y)

print(thistuple)

Output: ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange')
<hr>
<mark>Python - Unpack Tuples</mark>
Unpacking a Tuple
When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple:

Example:
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

(green, yellow, red) = fruits

print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)

Output: 
apple
banana
cherry
<hr>
<mark>Python - Loop Tuples</mark>
Loop Through a Tuple
You can loop through the tuple items by using a for loop.
Example:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for x in thistuple:
  print(x)

  Output:
  apple
  banana
  cherry
  <hr>
  <mark>Python - Join Tuples</mark>
  Join Two Tuples
  To join two or more tuples you can use the + operator:
  Example:
  tuple1 = ("a", "b" , "c")
  tuple2 = (1, 2, 3)

  tuple3 = tuple1 + tuple2
  print(tuple3)

  Output: ('a', 'b', 'c', 1, 2, 3)

<h1>Python Sets</h1>
<div><p>
Set<br>
Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.<br>
<br>
Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary,<br>
all with different qualities and usage.<br>
<br>
A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.<br>

<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Example:
set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
set2 = {1, 5, 7, 9, 3}

print(set1)
print(set2)
print(set3)

Output:
{'cherry', 'apple', 'banana'}
{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
{False, True}
<hr>
Set Items
Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
<hr>
Unordered
Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.

Set items can appear in a different order every time you use them, and cannot be referred to by index or key.
<hr>
Unchangeable
Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.

<mark>Python - Access Set Items</mark>
Access Items
You cannot access items in a set by referring to an index or a key.

But you can loop through the set items using a for loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a set, by using the in keyword.

Example:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

for x in thisset:
  print(x)

  Output:
  apple
 cherry
 banana

<mark>Python - Remove Set Items</mark>
Remove Item
To remove an item in a set, use the remove(), or the discard() method.

Example:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

thisset.remove("banana")

print(thisset)

Output: {'apple', 'cherry'}

<h1>Python Dictionaries</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Dictionary
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:
Example:
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

Output: {'brand': 'Ford', 'model': 'Mustang', 'year': 1964}
<hr>
Ordered or Unordered?
As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

Unordered means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.
<hr>
Changeable
Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.
<hr>
Duplicates Not Allowed
<hr>
<mark>Python - Access Dictionary Items</mark>
Accessing Items
You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets:

Example:
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict["model"]
print(x)

Output: Mustang

<h1>Python If ... Else</h1>
<div><p>
Python Conditions and If statements<br>
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:<br>
<br>
Equals: a == b<br>
Not Equals: a != b<br>
Less than: a < b<br>
Less than or equal to: a <= b<br>
Greater than: a > b<br>
Greater than or equal to: a >= b<br>
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.<br>
<br>
An "if statement" is written by using the <mark>if</mark> keyword.<br>
</p></div>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Example:
a = 33
b = 200

if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")

Output: b is greater than a

In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a.
As a is 33, and b is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".
<hr>
<mark>Elif</mark>
The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".

Example
a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
  
  Output: a is greater than b
  <hr>
 Short Hand If
If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.
Example:
a = 2
b = 330

print("A") if a > b else print("B")

Output: 8
<hr>

</pre>
<h1>Python While Loops</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  Python Loops
  Python has two primitive loop commands:
  
  while loops
  for loops
  The while Loop
  With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
  
  Example:
  i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1

  Output:
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  <hr>
  The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.

 <mark>The break Statement</mark>
 With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:

 Example:
 i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if (i == 3):
    break
  i += 1

  Output:
  1
  2
  3
  <hr>
<mark>The continue Statement</mark>
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:

Example:
i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)

  Output:
  1
  2
  4
  5
  6
  <hr>
</pre>
<h1>Python For Loops</h1>
<div><p>
Python For Loops<br>
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).<br>
<br>
This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.<br>
<br>
With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.<br>
</p></div>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Example:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x) 

  Output:
  apple
  banana
  cherry
  <hr>
<mark>Looping Through a String</mark>
Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters:

Example
Loop through the letters in the word "banana":

for x in "banana":
  print(x) 

  Output:
  b
  a
  n
  a
  n
  a
  <hr>
<mark>The break Statement</mark>
With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:

Example
Exit the loop when x is "banana":

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x) 
  if x == "banana":
    break

    Output: apple
            banana
  <hr>

<mark>The continue Statement</mark>
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next:

Example
Do not print banana:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    continue
  print(x)   
  
  Output: apple
          cherry
          <hr>
          </pre>
  <h1>Python Functions</h1>        
  <div><p>
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.<br>
<br>
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.<br>
<br>
A function can return data as a result.
  </p></div>
  <pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  
    Creating a Function
    In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:
    
    Example
    def my_function():
      print("Hello from a function")
    
      <mark>Calling a Function</mark>
      To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:
      
      Example
      def my_function():
        print("Hello from a function")
      
      my_function()
    
      Output: Hello from a function
      <hr>
  <mark>Arguments</mark>
Information can be passed into functions as arguments.

Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.

The following example has a function with one argument (fname). When the function is called, we pass along a first name,
which is used inside the function to print the full name:

Example:
def my_function(fname):
  print(fname + " Refsnes")

my_function("Emil")
my_function("Tobias")
my_function("Linus")

Output: 
Emil Refsnes
Tobias Refsnes
Linus Refsnes
<hr>

Parameters or Arguments?
The terms parameter and argument can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function.

From a function's perspective:

A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.

An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.

Number of Arguments
By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less.

Example:
def my_function(fname, lname):
  print(fname + " " + lname)

my_function("Emil", "Refsnes")

Output: Emil Refsnes

<hr>
<mark>Arbitrary Keyword Arguments, **kwargs</mark>
If you do not know how many keyword arguments that will be passed into your function, add two asterisk: ** before the parameter name in the function definition.

This way the function will receive a dictionary of arguments, and can access the items accordingly:

Example:
def my_function(**kid):
  print("His last name is " + kid["lname"])

my_function(fname = "Tobias", lname = "Refsnes")

Output: His last name is Refsnes
<hr>
<mark>Recursion</mark>
Python also accepts function recursion, which means a defined function can call itself.

Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself.
This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.

The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates,
or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power.
However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.

In this example, tri_recursion() is a function that we have defined to call itself ("recurse"). We use the k variable as the data, which decrements (-1)
every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the condition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0).

To a new developer it can take some time to work out how exactly this works, best way to find out is by testing and modifying it.

Example:
Recursion Example

def tri_recursion(k):
  if(k > 0):
    result = k + tri_recursion(k - 1)
    print(result)
  else:
    result = 0
  return result

print("\n\nRecursion Example Results")
tri_recursion(6)

Output:

    <h1>Python Lambda:</h1>
    <pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
A lambda function is a small anonymous function.

A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

Syntax
lambda arguments : expression
The expression is executed and the result is returned:

Example:
x = lambda a, b, c: a + b + c
print(x(5, 6, 2))

Output: 13
<hr>

Why Use Lambda Functions?
The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function.

Say you have a function definition that takes one argument, and that argument will be multiplied with an unknown number:

def myfunc(n):
  return lambda a : a * n
Use that function definition to make a function that always doubles the number you send in:

Example:
def myfunc(n):
  return lambda a : a * n

mydoubler = myfunc(2)

print(mydoubler(11))

Output: 22

</pre>
<h1>Python Arrays:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
<mark>What is an Array?</mark>
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:
<hr>
car1 = "Ford"
car2 = "Volvo"
car3 = "BMW"
However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?
<hr>
The solution is an array!

An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.
<hr>
Access the Elements of an Array
You refer to an array element by referring to the index number.

Example
Get the value of the first array item:

cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]

x = cars[0]
print(x)

Output: Ford
<hr>

Looping Array Elements
You can use the for in loop to loop through all the elements of an array.
Example:
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]

for x in cars:
  print(x)

  Output:
  Ford
  Volvo
  BMW
  <hr>

<mark>Array Methods</mark>
Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on lists/arrays.

Method	Description
append()	Adds an element at the end of the list
clear()	Removes all the elements from the list
copy()	Returns a copy of the list
count()	Returns the number of elements with the specified value
extend()	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
index()	Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
insert()	Adds an element at the specified position
pop()	Removes the element at the specified position
remove()	Removes the first item with the specified value
reverse()	Reverses the order of the list
sort()	Sorts the list

</pre>
<h1>Python Classes and Objects:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Python Classes/Objects
Python is an object oriented programming language.

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

Create a Class
To create a class, use the keyword class:

Example
Create a class named MyClass, with a property named x:

class MyClass:
  x = 5

  print(MyClass)

  Output: < class '__main__.MyClass'>< /class>
  <hr>

<mark>The __init__() Function</mark>
The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.

To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.

All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.

Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:

Example:
Create a class named Person, use the __init__() function to assign values for name and age:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)

Output: John
        36
<hr>
<mark>The __str__() Function</mark>
The __str__() function controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string.

If the __str__() function is not set, the string representation of the object is returned:

Example
The string representation of an object WITHOUT the __str__() function:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1)

Output: < __main__.Person object at 0x15039e602100>< /__main__.Person>

<hr>
<mark>Object Methods</mark>
Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.

Let us create a method in the Person class:

Example
Insert a function that prints a greeting, and execute it on the p1 object:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def myfunc(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()

Output: Hello my name is John
<hr>

The self Parameter
The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.

It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class:

Example
Use the words mysillyobject and abc instead of self:

class Person:
  def __init__(mysillyobject, name, age):
    mysillyobject.name = name
    mysillyobject.age = age

  def myfunc(abc):
    print("Hello my name is " + abc.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()
 
Output:Hello my name is John
<hr>
</pre>
<h1>Python Inheritance</h1>
<div><p>
Python Inheritance<br>
Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.<br>
<br>
Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.<br>
<br>
Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.
</p></div>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Create a Parent Class
Any class can be a parent class, so the syntax is the same as creating any other class:

Example
Create a class named Person, with firstname and lastname properties, and a printname method:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

#Use the Person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:

x = Person("John", "Doe")
x.printname()

Output: John Doe
<hr>
Create a Child Class
To create a class that inherits the functionality from another class, send the parent class as a parameter when creating the child class:

Example
Create a class named Student, which will inherit the properties and methods from the Person class:

class Student(Person):
  pass

Example
Use the Student class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student(Person):
  pass

x = Student("Shantanu", "Shinde")
x.printname()

Output: Shantanu Shinde
<hr>
<mark>Add the __init__() Function</mark>
So far we have created a child class that inherits the properties and methods from its parent.

We want to add the __init__() function to the child class (instead of the pass keyword).

Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.

Example
Add the __init__() function to the Student class:

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    
 Example:
 class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    Person.__init__(self, fname, lname)

x = Student("Durvesh", "Wath")
x.printname()

Output: Durvesh Wath
<hr>
<mark>Use the super() Function</mark>
Python also has a super() function that will make the child class inherit all the methods and properties from its parent:

Example:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)

x = Student("Gargi", "Magarde")
x.printname()

Output: Gargi Magarde
<hr>

</pre>
<h1>Python Iterators</h1>
<div><P>
Python Iterators<br>
An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.<br>
<br>
An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values.<br>
<br>
Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods __iter__() and __next__().<br>
</P></div>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  <mark>Iterator vs Iterable</mark>
  Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. They are iterable containers which you can get an iterator from.
  
  All these objects have a iter() method which is used to get an iterator:
  
  Example
  Return an iterator from a tuple, and print each value:

  mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
  myit = iter(mytuple)

  print(next(myit))
  print(next(myit))
  print(next(myit))

  Output:apple
         banana
         cherry

<hr>

<mark>Create an Iterator</mark>
To create an object/class as an iterator you have to implement the methods __iter__() and __next__() to your object.

As you have learned in the Python Classes/Objects chapter, all classes have a function called __init__(), which allows you to do some initializing when the object is being created.

The __iter__() method acts similar, you can do operations (initializing etc.), but must always return the iterator object itself.

The __next__() method also allows you to do operations, and must return the next item in the sequence.

Example
Create an iterator that returns numbers, starting with 1, and each sequence will increase by one (returning 1,2,3,4,5 etc.):

class MyNumbers:
  def __iter__(self):
    self.a = 1
    return self

  def __next__(self):
    x = self.a
    self.a += 1
    return x

myclass = MyNumbers()
myiter = iter(myclass)

print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))

Output: 
1
2
3
4
5
<hr>
StopIteration
The example above would continue forever if you had enough next() statements, or if it was used in a for loop.

To prevent the iteration to go on forever, we can use the StopIteration statement.

In the __next__() method, we can add a terminating condition to raise an error if the iteration is done a specified number of times:

Example:
Stop after 20 iterations:

class MyNumbers:
  def __iter__(self):
    self.a = 1
    return self

  def __next__(self):
    if self.a <= 20:
      x = self.a
      self.a += 1
      return x
    else:
      raise StopIteration

myclass = MyNumbers()
myiter = iter(myclass)

for x in myiter:
  print(x)

Output: 
1

<h1>Python Datetime</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Python Dates
A date in Python is not a data type of its own, but we can import a module named datetime to work with dates as date objects.
<hr>
Example
Import the datetime module and display the current date:

import datetime

x = datetime.datetime.now()

print(x)

<hr>
The date contains year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond.

The datetime module has many methods to return information about the date object.

Here are a few examples, you will learn more about them later in this chapter:

<h1>Python JSON</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.

  JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.
  
  JSON in Python
  Python has a built-in package called json, which can be used to work with JSON data.
  
  Example
  Import the json module:
  
  import json
  Parse JSON - Convert from JSON to Python
  If you have a JSON string, you can parse it by using the json.loads() method

  Example
Convert from JSON to Python:
import json

# some JSON:
x = '{ "name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}'

# parse x:
y = json.loads(x)

# the result is a Python dictionary:
print(y["age"])

Output: 30
<hr>
Example:

import json

print(json.dumps({"name": "John", "age": 30}))
print(json.dumps(["apple", "bananas"]))
print(json.dumps(("apple", "bananas")))
print(json.dumps("hello"))
print(json.dumps(42))
print(json.dumps(31.76))
print(json.dumps(True))
print(json.dumps(False))
print(json.dumps(None))

Output:
{"name": "John", "age": 30}
["apple", "bananas"]
["apple", "bananas"]

</pre>
<h1>Python Try Except</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.

The except block lets you handle the error.

The else block lets you execute code when there is no error.

The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.

Exception Handling
When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message.

These exceptions can be handled using the try statement:

Example:
try:
  print(x)
except:
  print("An exception occurred")

  Output: An exception occurred
  <hr>
Many Exceptions
You can define as many exception blocks as you want, e.g. if you want to execute a special block of code for a special kind of error:

Example
Print one message if the try block raises a NameError and another for other errors:
try:
  print(x)
except NameError:
  print("Variable x is not defined")
except:
  print("Something else went wrong")

  Output: Variable x is not defined
