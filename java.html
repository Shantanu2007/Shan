    <h1>Java Introduction:</h1>
    <div><p>
<mark>What is Java?</mark><br>
Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.<br>
<br>
It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.<br>
<br>
It is used for:<br>
<br>
1.Mobile applications (specially Android apps)<br>
2.Desktop applications<br>
3.Web applications<br>
4.Web servers and application <br>
5.Games<br>
6.Database connection<br>
And much, much more!<br>
    </p></div>

 <div><p>
<mark>Why Use Java?</mark><br>
Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)<br>
1.It is one of the most popular programming language in the world<br>
2.It has a large demand in the current job market<br>
3.It is easy to learn and simple to use<br>
4.It is open-source and free<br>
5.It is secure, fast and powerful<br>
6.It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)<br>
Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs<br>
As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa<br>

 <h1>Java Syntax</h1>
 <pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">

Example:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
  }

  Output: Hello World

  <hr>
Example explained
Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Main.
A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.

<strong>Note</strong>: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.

The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename.
To run the example above on your computer, make sure that Java is properly installed: Go to the Get Started Chapter for how to install Java.
The output should be:

Hello World

The main Method
The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:

<strong>public static void main(String[] args)</strong>
Any code inside the main() method will be executed. Don't worry about the keywords before and after main.
You will get to know them bit by bit while reading this tutorial.

For now, just remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, and
that every program must contain the main() method.

System.out.println()
Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
  }

  Output: Hello World
  <hr>
  </pre>
  <h1>Java Output / Print:</h1>
  <pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Print Text
You learned from the previous chapter that you can use the println() method to output values or print text in Java:

Example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
  }

Output: Hello World!

<hr>

You can add as many println() methods as you want. Note that it will add a new line for each method:

Example:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World!");
      System.out.println("I am learning Java.");
      System.out.println("It is awesome!");
    }
  }
  
  Output: Hello World!
          I am learning Java.
          It is awesome!
          <hr>

    Double Quotes
When you are working with text, it must be wrapped inside double quotations marks "".

If you forget the double quotes, an error occurs:

Example
System.out.println("This sentence will work!");

<p1 style="color:brown">Example:</p1>
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println(This sentence will produce an error);
    }
  }

  Output:<p1 style="color:brown">Main.java:3: error: ')' expected
    System.out.println(This sentence will produce an error);
                           ^
Main.java:3: error: ';' expected
    System.out.println(This sentence will produce an error);
                                         ^
Main.java:3: error: ';' expected
    System.out.println(This sentence will produce an error);
                                                   ^
Main.java:3: error: not a statement
    System.out.println(This sentence will produce an error);
                                                    ^
Main.java:3: error: ';' expected
    System.out.println(This sentence will produce an error);
                                                         ^
5 errors
</p1>
<hr>
<mark>The Print() Method</mark>
There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().

The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:

Example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.print("Hello World! ");
      System.out.print("I will print on the same line.");
    }
  }

  Output: Hello World! I will print on the same line.
  <hr>
<mark>Print Numbers</mark>
You can also use the println() method to print numbers.

However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes:

Example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println(3);
      System.out.println(358);
      System.out.println(50000);
    }
  }

  Output: 3
          358
          50000
          <hr>

    </pre>
<h1>Java Comments:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
    Java Comments
    Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.
    
    Single-line Comments
    Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).
    
    Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).
    
    This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

Example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      // This is a comment
      System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
  }
  
Output: Hello World
<hr>

<mark>Java Multi-line Comments</mark>
Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by Java.

This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:

Example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      /* The code below will print the words Hello World
      to the screen, and it is amazing */
      System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
  }

Output: Hello World
<hr>
</pre>
<h1>Java Variables:</h1>
<div><p>
Java Variables<br>
Variables are containers for storing data values.<br>
<br>
In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:<br>
<br>
1.String - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes<br>
2.int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123<br>
3.float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99<br>
4.char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes<br>
5.boolean - stores values with two states: true or false<br>
</p></div>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Declaring (Creating) Variables
To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:

Syntax
type variableName = value;
Where type is one of Java's types (such as int or String), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.

To create a variable that should store text, look at the following example:

Example
Create a variable called name of type String and assign it the value "John":

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      String name = "John";
      System.out.println(name);
    }
  }

  Output: John
  <hr>
  <mark>Java Print Variables:</mark>
  Display Variables
The println() method is often used to display variables.

To combine both text and a variable, use the + character:

Example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      String name = "Shantanu";
      System.out.println("Hello " + name);
    }
  }

  Output: Hello Shantanu
  <hr>
  <mark>Java Declare Multiple Variables:</mark>

  Declare Many Variables
To declare more than one variable of the same type, you can use a comma-separated list:

Example
Instead of writing:

int x = 5;
int y = 6;
int z = 50;
System.out.println(x + y + z);

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
      System.out.println(x + y + z);
    }
  }

  Output: 61
  <hr>
<mark>Identifiers:</mark>
All Java variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

Note: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code:

Example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Good
      int minutesPerHour = 60;
  
      // OK, but not so easy to understand what m actually is
      int m = 60;
      
      System.out.println(minutesPerHour);
      System.out.println(m);
    }
  }

  Output: 60
          60
<hr>
The general rules for naming variables are:

1.Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
2.Names must begin with a letter
3.Names should start with a lowercase letter and it cannot contain whitespace
4.Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
5.Names are case sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names
<hr>
</pre>
<h1>Java Data Types:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Java Data Types
As explained in the previous chapter, a variable in Java must be a specified data type:

Example:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      int myNum = 5;               // integer (whole number)
      float myFloatNum = 5.99f;    // floating point number
      char myLetter = 'D';         // character
      boolean myBool = true;       // boolean
      String myText = "Hello";     // String    
      System.out.println(myNum);
      System.out.println(myFloatNum);
      System.out.println(myLetter);
      System.out.println(myBool);
      System.out.println(myText);
    }
  }
  
  Output: 5
          5.99
          D
          true
          Hello
          <hr>
Data types are divided into two groups:

Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes (you will learn more about these in a later chapter)

<mark>Primitive Data Types</mark>
A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods.

There are eight primitive data types in Java:

<table border="5px">
    <tr>
        <th>Data Type</th>
        <th> Size </th>
        <th> Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>byte</td>
        <td> 1 byte  </td> 
        <td> Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127  </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>short</td>
        <td> 2 bytes   </td>
        <td> Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>int</td>
        <td> 4 bytes </td>
        <td> Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>long</td>
        <td> 8 byte  </td> 
        <td> Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807  </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>float</td>
        <td> 4 bytes   </td>
        <td> Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>double</td>
        <td> 8 bytes </td>
        <td> Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>boolean</td>
        <td> 1 bit   </td>
        <td> Stores true or false values </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>char</td>
        <td> 2 bytes </td>
        <td> Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    <hr>
<mark>Java Numbers</mark>
Numbers
Primitive number types are divided into two groups:

Integer types stores whole numbers, positive or negative (such as 123 or -456), without decimals.
Valid types are byte, short, int and long. Which type you should use, depends on the numeric value.

Floating point types represents numbers with a fractional part, containing one or more decimals. There are two types: float and double.

Even though there are many numeric types in Java, the most used for numbers are int (for whole numbers) and double (for floating point numbers).
However, we will describe them all as you continue to read.

Integer Types
Byte
The byte data type can store whole numbers from -128 to 127. This can be used instead of int or other integer types to
save memory when you are certain that the value will be within -128 and 127

Example:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      byte myNum = 100;
      System.out.println(myNum);  
    }
  }

  Output: 100
  <hr>
<mark>Short</mark>
The short data type can store whole numbers from -32768 to 32767:

Example
short myNum = 5000;
System.out.println(myNum);
<hr>
<mark>Int</mark>
The int data type can store whole numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647. In general, and in our tutorial, the int data type is the preferred data type when we create variables with a numeric value.

Example
int myNum = 100000;
System.out.println(myNum);
<hr>
<mark>Long</mark>
The long data type can store whole numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807.
This is used when int is not large enough to store the value. Note that you should end the value with an "L":

Example
long myNum = 15000000000L;
System.out.println(myNum);
<hr>
<mark>Floating Point Types</mark>
You should use a floating point type whenever you need a number with a decimal, such as 9.99 or 3.14515.

The float and double data types can store fractional numbers. Note that you should end the value with an "f" for floats and "d" for doubles:

Float Example
float myNum = 5.75f;
System.out.println(myNum);
<hr>
<mark>Scientific Numbers</mark>
A floating point number can also be a scientific number with an "e" to indicate the power of 10:

Example
float f1 = 35e3f;
double d1 = 12E4d;
System.out.println(f1);
System.out.println(d1);
<hr>
<mark>Java Boolean Data Types:</mark>
Boolean Types
Very often in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like:

YES / NO
ON / OFF
TRUE / FALSE
For this, Java has a boolean data type, which can only take the values true or false:

Example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      boolean isJavaFun = true;
      boolean isFishTasty = false;    
      System.out.println(isJavaFun);
      System.out.println(isFishTasty);
    }
  }

  Output: true
          false
          <hr>

<mark>Java Characters:</mark>
Characters
The char data type is used to store a single character. The character must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c':

Example:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      char myVar1 = 65, myVar2 = 66, myVar3 = 67;
      System.out.println(myVar1);
      System.out.println(myVar2);
      System.out.println(myVar3);
    }
  }
  
  Output: A 
          B 
          C 
          <hr>
<mark>Java Non-Primitive Data Types:</mark>

Non-Primitive Data Types
Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.

The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types are:

Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String).
Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be null.
A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.
The size of a primitive type depends on the data type, while non-primitive types have all the same size.
Examples of non-primitive types are Strings, Arrays, Classes, Interface, etc. You will learn more about these in a later chapter.
<hr>
</pre>
<h1>Java Type Casting:</h1>
<div><p>
Java Type Casting<br>
Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.<br>
<br>
In Java, there are two types of casting:<br>
<br>
Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size<br>
<p1 style="background-color:aquamarine">byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double</p1><br>
<br>
Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type<br>
<p1 style="background-color:aquamarine">double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte<br></p1>
</p></div>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">

<mark>Widening Casting</mark>
Widening casting is done automatically when passing a smaller size type to a larger size type:
    
Example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      int myInt = 9;
      double myDouble = myInt; // Automatic casting: int to double
  
      System.out.println(myInt);
      System.out.println(myDouble);
    }
  }

  Output: 9
          9.0
<hr>
<mark>Narrowing Casting</mark>
Narrowing casting must be done manually by placing the type in parentheses in front of the value:

Example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      double myDouble = 9.78d;
      int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Explicit casting: double to int
  
      System.out.println(myDouble);
      System.out.println(myInt);
    }
  }

  Output: 9.78
          9
          <hr>
    </pre>
<h1>Java Operators:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Java Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
    
In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
    
Example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      int x = 100 + 50;
      System.out.println(x);
    }
  }

  Output: 150
  <hr>
Java divides the operators into the following groups:

1.Arithmetic operators
2.Assignment operators
3.Comparison operators
4.Logical operators
5.Bitwise operators
6.Arithmetic Operators

<mark>Arithmetic Operators</mark>
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

<mark>Java Comparison Operators</mark>
Comparison operators are used to compare two values. This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

The return value of a comparison is either true or false. These values are known as Boolean values, and you will learn more about
them in the Booleans and If..Else chapter.

<h1>Java Strings:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Java Strings
Strings are used for storing text.

A String variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes:

Example
Create a variable of type String and assign it a value:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      String greeting = "Hello";
      System.out.println(greeting);
    }
  }

  Output: Hello

String Length
A String in Java is actually an object, which contain methods that can perform certain operations on strings.
For example, the length of a string can be found with the length() method:

<mark>Java String Concatenation:</mark>

String Concatenation
The + operator can be used between strings to combine them. This is called concatenation:

Example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
      String firstName = "Shantanu";
      String lastName = "Shinde";
      System.out.println(firstName + " " + lastName);
    }
  }
  
  Output: Shantanu Shinde

  <mark>Java Numbers and Strings</mark>
Adding Numbers and Strings

<p1 style="background-color:pink">WARNING!
Java uses the + operator for both addition and concatenation.
Numbers are added. Strings are concatenated.</p1>

If you add two numbers, the result will be a number:

Example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      String x = "10";
      int y = 20;
      String z = x + y;
      System.out.println(z);
    }
  }

<h1>Java Math</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
The Java Math class has many methods that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

Math.max(x,y)
The Math.max(x,y) method can be used to find the highest value of x and y:
    
Example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println(Math.max(5, 10));  
    }
    }

Output: 10
<hr>
Math.min(x,y)
The Math.min(x,y) method can be used to find the lowest value of x and y:

Example:
Math.min(5, 10);
    
<hr>
Math.sqrt(x)
The Math.sqrt(x) method returns the square root of x:

Example:
Math.sqrt(64);
<hr>

Math.abs(x)
The Math.abs(x) method returns the absolute (positive) value of x:

Example
Math.abs(-4.7);

<hr>
Random Numbers
Math.random() returns a random number between 0.0 (inclusive), and 1.0 (exclusive):

Example
Math.random();
<hr>
Example
int randomNum = (int)(Math.random() * 101);  // 0 to 100
<hr>
    </pre>
    <h1>Java Booleans:</h1>

      Java Booleans<br>
      Very often, in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like:<br>
      <br>
      YES / NO<br>
      ON / OFF<br>
      TRUE / FALSE<br>
      For this, Java has a boolean data type, which can store true or false values.</p></div>

      <h1>Java If ... Else:</h1>
      <div><p>
Java Conditions and If Statements<br>
Java supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:<br>
<br>
1.Less than: a < b<br>
2.Less than or equal to: a <= b<br>
3.Greater than: a > b<br>
4.Greater than or equal to: a >= b<br>
5.Equal to a == b<br>
6.Not Equal to: a != b<br>
You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.<br>
<br>
Java has the following conditional statements:<br>
<br>
1.Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true<br>
2.Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false<br>
3.Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false<br>
4.Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed<br>
      </p></div>
      <pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
      Example:
      Using if
      public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
          int x = 20;
          int y = 18;

      <mark>Java Short Hand If...Else (Ternary Operator)</mark>
Short Hand If...Else
There is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the ternary operator because it consists of three operands.

It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line, and is most often used to replace simple if else statements:

Example:

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {   
    int time = 20;
    String result;
    result = (time < 18) ? "Good day." : "Good evening.";

<h1>Java Switch:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  Java Switch Statements:
  Instead of writing many if..else statements, you can use the switch statement.
  
  The switch statement selects one of many code blocks to be executed:
  
  <mark>Syntax</mark>
  switch(expression) {
    case x:
      // code block
      break;
    case y:
      // code block
      break;
    default:
      // code block
  }
  This is how it works:
  
  1.The switch expression is evaluated once.
  2.The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
  3.If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
  4.The break and default keywords are optional, and will be described later in this chapter
  The example below uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:

Example:

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int day = 4;
    switch (day) {
      case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
      case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
        break;
      case 3:
        System.out.println("Wednesday");
        break;
      case 4:
        System.out.println("Thursday");
        break;
      case 5:
        System.out.println("Friday");
        break;
      case 6:
        System.out.println("Saturday");
        break;
      case 7:
        System.out.println("Sunday");
        break;
    }
  }
}
Output: Thursday
<hr>
<mark>The break Keyword</mark>
When Java reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.

This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.

When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.

A break can save a lot of execution time because it "ignores" the execution of all the rest of the code in the switch block.
</pre>
<h1>Java While Loop:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  Loops
  Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.
  
  Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.
  
  Java While Loop
  The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:
  
  <mark>Syntax</mark>
  while (condition) {
    // code block to be executed
  }
  In the example below, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 5:
  
  Example:

  public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      int i = 0;
      while (i < 5) {
        System.out.println(i);
        i++;
      }  
    }
  }
  
  Output: 0
          1
          2
          3
          4
<hr>
The Do/While Loop
The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true,
then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

Syntax
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
The example below uses a do/while loop. The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false,
because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:

Example:

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i = 0;
    do {
      System.out.println(i);
      i++;
    }
    while (i < 5);  
  }
}

Output: 0
        1
        2
        3
        4
<hr>
</pre>
<h1>Java For Loop:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  Java For Loop
  When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop:
  
  Syntax
  for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
    // code block to be executed
  }
  Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
  
  Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
  
  Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
  
  The example below will print the numbers 0 to 4:
  
  Example:

  public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        System.out.println(i);
      }  
    }
  }

<h1>Java Break and Continue:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Java Break
You have already seen the break statement used in an earlier chapter of this tutorial. It was used to "jump out" of a switch statement.

The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop.

This example stops the loop when i is equal to 4:

Example:
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
      if (i == 4) {
        break;
      }
      System.out.println(i);
    }  
  }
}

Output: 0
        1
        2
        3

Break and Continue in While Loop
You can also use break and continue in while loops:

Break Example:

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i = 0;
    while (i < 10) {
      System.out.println(i);
      i++;
      if (i == 4) {
        break;
      }

<h1>Java Arrays:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Java Arrays
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets:

String[] cars;
We have now declared a variable that holds an array of strings. To insert values to it, you can place the values in a comma-separated list, inside curly braces:

String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
To create an array of integers, you could write:

int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};
Access the Elements of an Array
You can access an array element by referring to the index number.

This statement accesses the value of the first element in cars:

Example:

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
    System.out.println(cars[0]);
  }
}

Output: Volvo

<hr>
<h1>Java Methods:</h1>
<div><p>
A method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.<br>
<br>
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.<br>
<br>
Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.<br>
<br>
Why use methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.
</p></div>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  Create a Method
  A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses ().
  Java provides some pre-defined methods, such as System.out.println(), but you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions:
  
  Example:
  Create a method inside Main:
  
  public class Main {
    static void myMethod() {
      // code to be executed
    }
  }
   
  Example Explained
  myMethod() is the name of the method
  static means that the method belongs to the Main class and not an object of the Main class. You will learn more about objects and how to access methods through objects later in this tutorial.
  void means that this method does not have a return value. You will learn more about return values later in this chapter

  <mark>Call a Method</mark>
  To call a method in Java, write the method's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon;
  
  In the following example, myMethod() is used to print a text (the action), when it is called:
  Example:

  public class Main {
    static void myMethod() {
      System.out.println("I just got executed!");
    }
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      myMethod();
    }
  }
  Output: I just got executed!
  <hr>
 <mark> A method can also be called multiple times:</mark>
 Example:

 public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("I just got executed!");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod();
    myMethod();
    myMethod();
  }
}

Output: I just got executed!
         I just got executed!
         I just got executed!

  <h1>Java Method Parameters:</h1>
  <pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
    Parameters and Arguments
    Information can be passed to methods as parameter. Parameters act as variables inside the method.
    
    Parameters are specified after the method name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma.
    
    The following example has a method that takes a String called fname as parameter. When the method is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the method to print the full name:
    
    Example:

    public class Main {
      static void myMethod(String fname) {
        System.out.println(fname + " Refsnes");
      }
    
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        myMethod("Liam");
        myMethod("Jenny");
        myMethod("Anja");
      }
    }

    Output: Liam Refsnes
            Jenny Refsnes
            Anja Refsnes

  Variables declared directly inside a method are available anywhere in the method following the line of code in which they were declared:
  
  Example:
  public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
  
      // Code here CANNOT use x
  
      int x = 100;

<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">

Java Recursion
Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into
simple problems which are easier to solve.

Recursion may be a bit difficult to understand. The best way to figure out how it works is to experiment with it.

Recursion Example
Adding two numbers together is easy to do, but adding a range of numbers is more complicated. In the following example,
recursion is used to add a range of numbers together by breaking it down into the simple task of adding two numbers:

Ecample:
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int result = sum(10);
    System.out.println(result);
  }
  public static int sum(int k) {
    if (k > 0) {
      return k + sum(k - 1);
    } else {
      return 0;
    }
  }
}
Output: 55

<h1>Java OOP</h1>
<div><p>
Java - What is OOP?<br>
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.<br>
<br>
Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming<br>
is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.<br>
<br>
Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:<br>
<br>
1.OOP is faster and easier to execute<br>
2.OOP provides a clear structure for the programs<br>
3.OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug<br>
4.OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time<br>
Tip: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code.<br>
You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.<br>
<br>
Java - What are Classes and Objects?<br>
Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.<br>

</p></div>
<h1>Java Classes and Objects:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  Java Classes/Objects
  Java is an object-oriented programming language.
  
  Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.
  
  A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
  
  Create a Class
  To create a class, use the keyword class:

  Main.java
  Create a class named <mark>"Main"</mark> with a variable x:
  
  public class Main {
    int x = 5;
  }

<hr>
Example:
public class Main {
  int x = 5;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}

Output: 5
<hr>
Multiple Objects
You can create multiple objects of one class:

Example
Create two objects of Main:
public class Main {
  int x = 5;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj1 = new Main();
    Main myObj2 = new Main();
    System.out.println(myObj1.x);
    System.out.println(myObj2.x);
  }
}

Output: 5
        5
<hr>
</pre>
<h1>Java Class Attributes:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  Java Class Attributes
  In the previous chapter, we used the term "variable" for x in the example (as shown below). It is actually an attribute of the class. Or you could say that class attributes are variables within a class:
  
  Example
  Create a class called "Main" with two attributes: x and y:
  
  public class Main {
    int x = 5;
    int y = 3;
  }
  Another term for class attributes is fields.
  
  Accessing Attributes
  You can access attributes by creating an object of the class, and by using the dot syntax (.):
  
  The following example will create an object of the Main class, with the name myObj. We use the x attribute on the object to print its value:
  
  Example
  Create an object called "myObj" and print the value of x:
  
  public class Main {
    int x = 5;
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Main myObj = new Main();
      System.out.println(myObj.x);
    }
  }
  
Output: 5
<hr>
Multiple Attributes
You can specify as many attributes as you want:

Example
public class Main {
  String fname = "Shantanu";
  String lname = "Shinde";
  int age = 24;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    System.out.println("Name: " + myObj.fname + " " + myObj.lname);
    System.out.println("Age: " + myObj.age);
  }
}

Output: Name: Shantanu Shinde
        Age: 24
   <hr>
</pre>
<h1>Java Class Methods:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Java Class Methods
You learned from the Java Methods chapter that methods are declared within a class, and that they are used to perform certain actions:

Example
Create a method named myMethod() in Main:

public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
 
myMethod() prints a text (the action), when it is called. To call a method, write the method's name followed by two parentheses () anda semicolon;

Example:
Inside main, call myMethod():

public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod();
  }
}

Output: Hello World!
<hr>
<mark>Static vs. Public</mark>
You will often see Java programs that have either static or public attributes and methods.

In the example above, we created a static method, which means that it can be accessed without creating an object of the class, unlike public, which can only be accessed by objects:

Example:
An example to demonstrate the differences between static and public methods:

public class Main {
  // Static method
  static void myStaticMethod() {
    System.out.println("Static methods can be called without creating objects");
  }

  // Public method
  public void myPublicMethod() {
    System.out.println("Public methods must be called by creating objects");
  }

  // Main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myStaticMethod(); // Call the static method
    // myPublicMethod(); This would compile an error

    Main myObj = new Main(); // Create an object of Main
    myObj.myPublicMethod(); // Call the public method on the object
  }
}

Output: Static methods can be called without creating objects
        Public methods must be called by creating objects
<hr>
<mark>Access Methods With an Object</mark>

Example:
Create a Car object named myCar. Call the fullThrottle() and speed() methods on the myCar object, and run the program:

// Create a Main class
public class Main {
 
  // Create a fullThrottle() method
  public void fullThrottle() {
    System.out.println("The car is going as fast as it can!");
  }

  // Create a speed() method and add a parameter
  public void speed(int maxSpeed) {
    System.out.println("Max speed is: " + maxSpeed);
  }

  // Inside main, call the methods on the myCar object
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myCar = new Main();   // Create a myCar object
    myCar.fullThrottle();      // Call the fullThrottle() method
    myCar.speed(200);          // Call the speed() method
  }
}

Output: The car is going as fast as it can!
        Max speed is: 200
        <hr>

<h1>Java Constructors:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  Java Constructors
  A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes:
  
  Example:
  Create a constructor:
  
  // Create a Main class
  public class Main {
    int x;  // Create a class attribute
  
    // Create a class constructor for the Main class
    public Main() {
      x = 5;  // Set the initial value for the class attribute x
    }
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Main myObj = new Main(); // Create an object of class Main (This will call the constructor)
      System.out.println(myObj.x); // Print the value of x
    }
  }

Output: 5
<hr>
Constructor Parameters
Constructors can also take parameters, which is used to initialize attributes.

The following example adds an int y parameter to the constructor. Inside the constructor we set x to y (x=y).
When we call the constructor, we pass a parameter to the constructor (5), which will set the value of x to 5:

Example:

public class Main {
  int x;

  public Main(int y) {
    x = y;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main(5);
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}
Output: 5
<hr>
</pre>
<h1>Java Encapsulation:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  Encapsulation
  The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:
  
  declare class variables/attributes as private
  provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable
  Get and Set
  You learned from the previous chapter that private variables can only be accessed within the same class (an outside class has no access to it). However, it is possible to access them if we provide public get and set methods.
  
  The get method returns the variable value, and the set method sets the value.
  
  Syntax for both is that they start with either get or set, followed by the name of the variable, with the first letter in upper case:
  
  Example:

  public class Person {
    private String name; // private = restricted access
  
    // Getter
    public String getName() {
      return name;
    }
  
    // Setter
    public void setName(String newName) {
      this.name = newName;
    }
  }

  <hr>
Why Encapsulation?
1.Better control of class attributes and methods
2.Class attributes can be made read-only (if you only use the get method), or write-only (if you only use the set method)
3.Flexible: the programmer can change one part of the code without affecting other parts
Increased security of data

</pre>
<h1>Java Packages</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Java Packages & API
A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories:

Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
User-defined Packages (create your own packages)
Built-in Packages
The Java API is a library of prewritten classes, that are free to use, included in the Java Development Environment.

The library contains components for managing input, database programming, and much much more.
The complete list can be found at Oracles website: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/.

The library is divided into packages and classes. Meaning you can either import a single class (along with its methods and attributes),
or a whole package that contain all the classes that belong to the specified package.

To use a class or a package from the library, you need to use the import keyword:

Syntax
import package.name.Class;   // Import a single class
import package.name.*;   // Import the whole package
Import a Class
If you find a class you want to use, for example, the Scanner class, which is used to get user input, write the following code:

Example
import java.util.Scanner;
In the example above, java.util is a package, while Scanner is a class of the java.util package.

To use the Scanner class, create an object of the class and use any of the available methods found in the Scanner class documentation.
In our example, we will use the nextLine() method, which is used to read a complete line:

Example:
import java.util.Scanner; // import the Scanner class 

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner myObj = new Scanner(System.in);
    String userName;
    
    // Enter username and press Enter
    System.out.println("Enter username"); 
    userName = myObj.nextLine();   
       
    System.out.println("Username is: " + userName);        
  }
}

Output: Enter username

</pre>
<h1>Java Inheritance:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Java Inheritance (Subclass and Superclass)
In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:

subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from
To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.

In the example below, the Car class (subclass) inherits the attributes and methods from the Vehicle class (superclass):

Example:

class Vehicle {
  protected String brand = "Ford";
  public void honk() {
    System.out.println("Tuut, tuut!");
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  private String modelName = "Mustang";
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Car myFastCar = new Car();
    myFastCar.honk();
    System.out.println(myFastCar.brand + " " + myFastCar.modelName);
  }
}

Output: Tuut, tuut!
        Ford Mustang

<h1>Java Polymorphism:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  Java Polymorphism
  Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
  
  Like we specified in the previous chapter; Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class.
  Polymorphism uses those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
  
  For example, think of a superclass called Animal that has a method called animalSound().
  Subclasses of Animals could be Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the pig oinks, and the cat meows, etc.):
  
  Example:

  class Animal {
    public void animalSound() {
      System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");
    }
  }
  
  class Pig extends Animal {
    public void animalSound() {
      System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
    }
  }
  
  class Dog extends Animal {
    public void animalSound() {
      System.out.println("The dog says: bow wow");
    }
  }

<hr>
Example:
class Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");
  }
}

class Pig extends Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    System.out.println("The dog says: bow wow");
  }
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Animal myAnimal = new Animal();
    Animal myPig = new Pig();
    Animal myDog = new Dog();
        
    myAnimal.animalSound();
    myPig.animalSound();
    myDog.animalSound();
  }
} 

Output: The animal makes a sound
        The pig says: wee wee
        The dog says: bow wow
 <hr>
</pre>
<h1>Java Inner Classes:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  Java Inner Classes
  In Java, it is also possible to nest classes (a class within a class). The purpose of nested classes is to group classes that belong together, which makes your code more readable and maintainable.
  
  To access the inner class, create an object of the outer class, and then create an object of the inner class:
  
  Example:
  class OuterClass {
    int x = 10;
  
    class InnerClass {
      int y = 5;
    }
  }
  
  public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      OuterClass myOuter = new OuterClass();
      OuterClass.InnerClass myInner = myOuter.new InnerClass();
      System.out.println(myInner.y + myOuter.x);
    }
  }

Output: 15

<h1>Java Abstraction:</h1>
<div><p>
Abstract Classes and Methods<br>
Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.<br>
Abstraction can be achieved with either abstract classes or interfaces (which you will learn more about in the next chapter).<br>
<br>
The abstract keyword is a non-access modifier, used for classes and methods:<br>
<br>
Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class).<br>
<br>
Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from).<br>

</p></div>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  An abstract class can have both abstract and regular methods:
  Example:
  abstract class Animal {
    public abstract void animalSound();
    public void sleep() {
      System.out.println("Zzz");
    }
  }
<hr>
Example:

// Abstract class
abstract class Animal {
  // Abstract method (does not have a body)
  public abstract void animalSound();
  // Regular method
  public void sleep() {
    System.out.println("Zzz");
  }
}

// Subclass (inherit from Animal)
class Pig extends Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Pig myPig = new Pig(); // Create a Pig object
    myPig.animalSound();
    myPig.sleep();
  }
}

Output: The pig says: wee wee
          Zzz
<hr>
</pre>
<h1>Java Interface:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  Interfaces
  Another way to achieve abstraction in Java, is with interfaces.
  
  An interface is a completely "abstract class" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies:
  
  <mark>Example:</mark>
  // interface
  interface Animal {
    public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
    public void run(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  }
   
  To access the interface methods, the interface must be "implemented" (kinda like inherited) by another class with the implements keyword (instead of extends).
  The body of the interface method is provided by the "implement" class:
  
  Example:

  interface Animal {
    public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
    public void sleep(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  }
  
  class Pig implements Animal {
    public void animalSound() {
      System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
    }
    public void sleep() {
      System.out.println("Zzz");
    }
  }
  
  class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Pig myPig = new Pig();
      myPig.animalSound();
      myPig.sleep();
    }
  }
  
  Output: The pig says: wee wee
           Zzz
<hr>
<mark>Multiple Interfaces</mark>
To implement multiple interfaces, separate them with a comma:

Example:

interface FirstInterface {
  public void myMethod(); // interface method
}

interface SecondInterface {
  public void myOtherMethod(); // interface method
}

// DemoClass "implements" FirstInterface and SecondInterface
class DemoClass implements FirstInterface, SecondInterface {
  public void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("Some text..");
  }
  public void myOtherMethod() {
    System.out.println("Some other text...");
  }
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    DemoClass myObj = new DemoClass();
    myObj.myMethod();
    myObj.myOtherMethod();
  }
}

Output: Some text...
        Some other text...
<hr>
</pre>
<h1>Java Enums:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Enums
An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).

To create an enum, use the enum keyword (instead of class or interface), and separate the constants with a comma.
Note that they should be in uppercase letters:

Example:

enum Level {
  LOW,
  MEDIUM,
  HIGH
}

public class Main { 
  public static void main(String[] args) { 
    Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM; 
    System.out.println(myVar); 
  } 
}

Output: MEDIUM
<hr>
Enum inside a Class
You can also have an enum inside a class:

Example:

public class Main { 
  enum Level {
    LOW,
    MEDIUM,
    HIGH
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) { 
    Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM; 
    System.out.println(myVar); 
  } 
}

Output: MEDIUM
<hr>
Enum in a Switch Statement
Enums are often used in switch statements to check for corresponding values:

Example:
enum Level {
  LOW,
  MEDIUM,
  HIGH
}

public class Main { 
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Level myVar = Level.MEDIUM; 
                
    switch(myVar) {
      case LOW:
        System.out.println("Low level");
        break;
      case MEDIUM:
        System.out.println("Medium level");
        break;
      case HIGH:
        System.out.println("High level");
        break;
    }
  }
}

Output: Medium level
<hr>
</pre>
<h1>Java User Input (Scanner):</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Java User Input
The Scanner class is used to get user input, and it is found in the java.util package.

To use the Scanner class, create an object of the class and use any of the available methods found in the Scanner class documentation.
In our example, we will use the nextLine() method, which is used to read Strings:

Example:

import java.util.Scanner; // import the Scanner class 

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner myObj = new Scanner(System.in);
    String userName;
    
    // Enter username and press Enter
    System.out.println("Enter username"); 
    userName = myObj.nextLine();   
       
    System.out.println("Username is: " + userName);        
  }
}

Output: Enter username
<hr>

<mark>Input Types</mark>
In the example above, we used the nextLine() method, which is used to read Strings. To read other types, look at the table below:

Method	           Description
nextBoolean()	Reads a boolean value from the user
nextByte()	Reads a byte value from the user
nextDouble()	Reads a double value from the user
nextFloat()	Reads a float value from the user
nextInt()	Reads a int value from the user
nextLine()	Reads a String value from the user
nextLong()	Reads a long value from the user
nextShort()	Reads a short value from the user
<hr>

</pre>
<h1>Java Date and Time:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
Java Dates
Java does not have a built-in Date class, but we can import the java.time package to work with the date and time API.
The package includes many date and time classes. For example:

Class	Description
LocalDate	Represents a date (year, month, day (yyyy-MM-dd))
LocalTime	Represents a time (hour, minute, second and nanoseconds (HH-mm-ss-ns))
LocalDateTime	Represents both a date and a time (yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss-ns)
DateTimeFormatter	Formatter for displaying and parsing date-time objects

Example:

import java.time.LocalDate;  // import the LocalDate class

public class Main {  
  public static void main(String[] args) {  
    LocalDate myObj = LocalDate.now();  // Create a date object
    System.out.println(myObj);  // Display the current date
  }  
}  

Output: It will give the correct Date.
<hr>
Formatting Date and Time
The "T" in the example above is used to separate the date from the time. You can use the DateTimeFormatter class with the ofPattern()
method in the same package to format or parse date-time objects. The following example will remove both the "T" and nanoseconds from the date-time:

Example:
import java.time.LocalDateTime; // Import the LocalDateTime class
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter; // Import the DateTimeFormatter class

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    LocalDateTime myDateObj = LocalDateTime.now();
    System.out.println("Before formatting: " + myDateObj);
    DateTimeFormatter myFormatObj = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss");

    String formattedDate = myDateObj.format(myFormatObj);
    System.out.println("After formatting: " + formattedDate);
  }
}

Output: Before Formatting: 2022-11-16T18:59:09.374195
        After Formatting: 16-11-2022 18:59:09

<h1>Java ArrayList:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  Java ArrayList
  The ArrayList class is a resizable array, which can be found in the java.util package.
  
  The difference between a built-in array and an ArrayList in Java, is that the size of an array cannot be modified (if you want to add or remove elements to/from an array,
  you have to create a new one). While elements can be added and removed from an ArrayList whenever you want. The syntax is also slightly different:

  Example:
  Create an ArrayList object called cars that will store strings:
  
  import java.util.ArrayList; // import the ArrayList class
  
  ArrayList< String> cars = new ArrayList< String>(); // Create an ArrayList object

  Add Items
  The ArrayList class has many useful methods. For example, to add elements to the ArrayList, use the add() method:

  Example:

  import java.util.ArrayList;

  public class Main { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
      ArrayList< String> cars = new ArrayList< String>();
      cars.add("Volvo");
      cars.add("BMW");
      cars.add("Ford");
      cars.add("Mazda");
      System.out.println(cars);
    } 
  }

  Output: [Volvo, BMW, Ford, Mazda]
  <hr>
<mark>Access an Item</mark>
To access an element in the ArrayList, use the get() method and refer to the index number:

Example:
cars.get(0);

<hr>
Change an Item
To modify an element, use the set() method and refer to the index number:

Example:

import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main { 
  public static void main(String[] args) { 
    ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>();
    cars.add("Volvo");
    cars.add("BMW");
    cars.add("Ford");
    cars.add("Mazda");
    cars.set(0, "Opel");
    System.out.println(cars);
  } 
}

<hr>
Remove an Item
To remove an element, use the remove() method and refer to the index number:

Example:
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main { 
  public static void main(String[] args) { 
    ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>();
    cars.add("Volvo");
    cars.add("BMW");
    cars.add("Ford");
    cars.add("Mazda");
    cars.remove(0);
    System.out.println(cars);
  } 
}

Output: [BMW, Ford, Mazda]

  <h1>Java LinkedList:</h1>
  <pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
    Java LinkedList
    In the previous chapter, you learned about the ArrayList class. The LinkedList class is almost identical to the ArrayList:
    
    Example:
    import java.util.LinkedList;

    public class Main { 
      public static void main(String[] args) { 
        LinkedList<String> cars = new LinkedList<String>();
        cars.add("Volvo");
        cars.add("BMW");
        cars.add("Ford");
        cars.add("Mazda");
        System.out.println(cars);
      } 
    }

    Output: [Volvo, BMW, Ford, Mazda]
    <hr>
<mark>ArrayList vs. LinkedList</mark>
The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type, just like the ArrayList.

The LinkedList class has all of the same methods as the ArrayList class because they both implement the List interface.
This means that you can add items, change items, remove items and clear the list in the same way.

However, while the ArrayList class and the LinkedList class can be used in the same way, they are built very differently.

How the ArrayList works
The ArrayList class has a regular array inside it. When an element is added, it is placed into the array.
If the array is not big enough, a new, larger array is created to replace the old one and the old one is removed.

How the LinkedList works
The LinkedList stores its items in "containers." The list has a link to the first container and each container has a link to the next container in the list.
To add an element to the list, the element is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other containers in the list.

LinkedList Methods
For many cases, the ArrayList is more efficient as it is common to need access to random items in the list,
but the LinkedList provides several methods to do certain operations more efficiently:

Method	             Description	
addFirst()	Adds an item to the beginning of the list.	
addLast()	Add an item to the end of the list	
removeFirst()	Remove an item from the beginning of the list.	
removeLast()	Remove an item from the end of the list	
getFirst()	Get the item at the beginning of the list	
getLast()	Get the item at the end of the list

<h1>Java HashMap:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  Java HashMap
  In the ArrayList chapter, you learned that Arrays store items as an ordered collection, and you have to access them with an index number (int type).
  A HashMap however, store items in "key/value" pairs, and you can access them by an index of another type (e.g. a String).
  
  One object is used as a key (index) to another object (value). It can store different types:
  String keys and Integer values, or the same type, like: String keys and String values:
  
  Example
  Create a HashMap object called capitalCities that will store String keys and String values:
  
  import java.util.HashMap; // import the HashMap class
  
  HashMap< String, String> capitalCities = new HashMap< String, String>();
  Add Items
  The HashMap class has many useful methods. For example, to add items to it, use the put() method:
  
  Example:
  import java.util.HashMap;

  public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      HashMap< String, String> capitalCities = new HashMap< String, String>();
      capitalCities.put("England", "London");
      capitalCities.put("Germany", "Berlin");
      capitalCities.put("Norway", "Oslo");
      capitalCities.put("USA", "Washington DC");
      System.out.println(capitalCities); 
    }
  }

  Output: {USA=Washington DC, Norway=Oslo, England=London, Germany=Berlin}
  <hr>
  </pre>
  <h1>Java HashSet:</h1>
  <pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
    Java HashSet
    A HashSet is a collection of items where every item is unique, and it is found in the java.util package:
    
    Example:
    Create a HashSet object called cars that will store strings:
    
    import java.util.HashSet; // Import the HashSet class
    
    HashSet< String> cars = new HashSet< String>();
    Add Items
    The HashSet class has many useful methods. For example, to add items to it, use the add() method:
    
    Example:
    // Import the HashSet class
    import java.util.HashSet;
    
    public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashSet< String> cars = new HashSet< String>();
        cars.add("Volvo");
        cars.add("BMW");
        cars.add("Ford");
        cars.add("BMW");
        cars.add("Mazda");
        System.out.println(cars);
      }
    }
  
  Output: [Volvo, Mazda, Ford, BMW]

<h1>Java Iterator:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  Java Iterator
  An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet.
  It is called an "iterator" because "iterating" is the technical term for looping.
  
  To use an Iterator, you must import it from the java.util package.
  
  Getting an Iterator
  The iterator() method can be used to get an Iterator for any collection:
  
  Example:
  import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Iterator;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  
    // Make a collection
    ArrayList< String> cars = new ArrayList< String>();
    cars.add("Volvo");
    cars.add("BMW");
    cars.add("Ford");
    cars.add("Mazda");
  
    // Get the iterator
    Iterator< String> it = cars.iterator();
  
    // Print the first item
    System.out.println(it.next());
  }
}

Output: Volvo
<hr>

</pre>
<h1>Java Wrapper Classes:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  Java Wrapper Classes
  Wrapper classes provide a way to use primitive data types (int, boolean, etc..) as objects.
  
  The table below shows the primitive type and the equivalent wrapper class:
  
  Primitive Data Type	    Wrapper Class
  byte	                       Byte
  short	                      Short
  int	                      Integer
  long	                     Long
  float	                    Float
  double	                   Double
  boolean	                   Boolean
  char	                   Character

  Sometimes you must use wrapper classes, for example when working with Collection objects, such as ArrayList,
  where primitive types cannot be used (the list can only store objects):

Example:

public class Main { 
  public static void main(String[] args) { 
    Integer myInt = 5; 
    Double myDouble = 5.99; 
    Character myChar = 'A'; 
    System.out.println(myInt);
    System.out.println(myDouble);
    System.out.println(myChar);
  }
}

Output: 5
        5.99
        A
<hr>
Since you're now working with objects, you can use certain methods to get information about the specific object.

For example, the following methods are used to get the value associated with the corresponding wrapper object:
intValue(), byteValue(), shortValue(), longValue(), floatValue(), doubleValue(), charValue(), booleanValue().

This example will output the same result as the example above:

Example:
public class Main { 
  public static void main(String[] args) { 
    Integer myInt = 5; 
    Double myDouble = 5.99; 
    Character myChar = 'A'; 
    System.out.println(myInt.intValue());
    System.out.println(myDouble.doubleValue());
    System.out.println(myChar.charValue());
  }
}

Output: 5
         5.99
         A

<h1>Java Exceptions - Try...Catch:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  Java Exceptions
  When executing Java code, different errors can occur: coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, or other unforeseeable things.
  
  When an error occurs, Java will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: Java will throw an exception (throw an error).
  
  Java try and catch
  The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
  
  The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.
  
  The try and catch keywords come in pairs:
  
  <mark>Syntax</mark>
  try {
    //  Block of code to try
  }
  catch(Exception e) {
    //  Block of code to handle errors
  }

Consider the following example:

This will generate an error, because myNumbers[10] does not exist.

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[ ] args) {
    int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
    System.out.println(myNumbers[10]); // error!
  }
}


<p1 style="color:brown">The output will be something like this:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 10
        at Main.main(Main.java:4)</p1>
<hr>
Finally
The finally statement lets you execute code, after try...catch, regardless of the result:

Example:
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      int[] myNumbers = {1, 2, 3};
      System.out.println(myNumbers[10]);
    } catch (Exception e) {
      System.out.println("Something went wrong.");
    } finally {
      System.out.println("The 'try catch' is finished.");
    }
  }
}
 
The output will be:
Something went wrong.
The 'try catch' is finished.
<hr>

The throw keyword
The throw statement allows you to create a custom error.

The throw statement is used together with an exception type. There are many exception types available in Java: ArithmeticException, FileNotFoundException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, SecurityException, etc:

Example
Throw an exception if age is below 18 (print "Access denied"). If age is 18 or older, print "Access granted":

public class Main {
  static void checkAge(int age) {
    if (age < 18) {
      throw new ArithmeticException("Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old.");
    }
    else {
      System.out.println("Access granted - You are old enough!");
    }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    checkAge(15); // Set age to 15 (which is below 18...)
  }
}

Output: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old.
        at Main.checkAge(Main.java:4)
        at Main.main(Main.java:12)

<h1>Java Regular Expressions:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
What is a Regular Expression?
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.

A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.

Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.

Java does not have a built-in Regular Expression class, but we can import the java.util.regex package to work with regular expressions. The package includes the following classes:

1. Pattern Class - Defines a pattern (to be used in a search)
2. Matcher Class - Used to search for the pattern
3. PatternSyntaxException Class - Indicates syntax error in a regular expression pattern

Example
Find out if there are any occurrences of the word "w3schools" in a sentence:

import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("w3schools", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE);
    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("Visit W3Schools!");
    boolean matchFound = matcher.find();
    if(matchFound) {
      System.out.println("Match found");
    } else {
      System.out.println("Match not found");
    }
  }
}

Output: Match found
<hr>

Example Explained
In this example, The word "w3schools" is being searched for in a sentence.

First, the pattern is created using the Pattern.compile() method. The first parameter indicates which pattern is being searched for and
the second parameter has a flag to indicates that the search should be case-insensitive. The second parameter is optional.

The matcher() method is used to search for the pattern in a string. It returns a Matcher object which contains information about the
search that was performed.

The find() method returns true if the pattern was found in the string and false if it was not found.

Flags
Flags in the compile() method change how the search is performed. Here are a few of them:

1. Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE - The case of letters will be ignored when performing a search.
2. Pattern.LITERAL - Special characters in the pattern will not have any special meaning and will be treated as ordinary characters when performing a search.
3. Pattern.UNICODE_CASE - Use it together with the CASE_INSENSITIVE flag to also ignore the case of letters outside of the English alphabet

<h1>Java Threads:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  <mark>Java Threads</mark>
  Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same time.
  
  Threads can be used to perform complicated tasks in the background without interrupting the main program.
  
  <mark>Creating a Thread</mark>
  There are two ways to create a thread.
  
  It can be created by extending the Thread class and overriding its run() method:
  <hr>
  <mark>Extend Syntax</mark>
  public class Main extends Thread {
    public void run() {
      System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
    }
  }
  Another way to create a thread is to implement the Runnable interface:
  <hr>
  <mark>Implement Syntax</mark>
  public class Main implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
      System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
    }
  }
<hr>
Running Threads
If the class extends the Thread class, the thread can be run by creating an instance of the class and call its start() method:

Extend Example:

public class Main extends Thread {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main thread = new Main();
    thread.start();
    System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");
  }
  public void run() {
    System.out.println("This code is running in a thread");
  }
}

Output: This code is outside of the thread
         This code is running in a thread
 <hr>
 Example:
Use isAlive() to prevent concurrency problems:

public class Main extends Thread {
  public static int amount = 0;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main thread = new Main();
    thread.start();
    // Wait for the thread to finish
    while(thread.isAlive()) {
    System.out.println("Waiting...");
  }
  // Update amount and print its value
  System.out.println("Main: " + amount);
  amount++;
  System.out.println("Main: " + amount);
  }
  public void run() {
    amount++;
  }
}      

Output: Waiting...
         Main: 1
         Main: 2

<h1>Java Lambda Expressions:</h1>
<pre style="font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif">
  Java Lambda Expressions
  Lambda Expressions were added in Java 8.
  
  A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value.
  Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.
  
  Syntax
  The simplest lambda expression contains a single parameter and an expression:
  
  parameter -> expression
  To use more than one parameter, wrap them in parentheses:
  
  (parameter1, parameter2) -> expression
  Expressions are limited. They have to immediately return a value, and they cannot contain variables, assignments or statements such as if or for.
  In order to do more complex operations, a code block can be used with curly braces. If the lambda expression needs to return a value, 
  then the code block should have a return statement.
  
  (parameter1, parameter2) -> { code block }

Using Lambda Expressions
Lambda expressions are usually passed as parameters to a function:

Example:
Use a lambda expression in the ArrayList's forEach() method to print every item in the list:

import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList< Integer> numbers = new ArrayList< Integer>();
    numbers.add(5);
    numbers.add(9);
    numbers.add(8);
    numbers.add(1);
    numbers.forEach( (n) -> { System.out.println(n); } );
  }
}

Output: 5
         9
         8
         1
 <hr>
 Example
Create a method which takes a lambda expression as a parameter:

interface StringFunction {
  String run(String str);
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    StringFunction exclaim = (s) -> s + "!";
    StringFunction ask = (s) -> s + "?";
    printFormatted("Hello", exclaim);
    printFormatted("Hello", ask);
  }
  public static void printFormatted(String str, StringFunction format) {
    String result = format.run(str);
    System.out.println(result);
  }
}

Output: Hello!
         Hello?
